Does insisting on running really change a person?

Running may not, but insisting on running really do. 

I myself witnessed the changes that have been brought to me by the whole process. This change is all-round.

Three years ago, I made a decision to be a runner.

I run every day, no matter where I am, starting five kilometers a day, because I know that men's failure begins with giving up self-discipline.

Running makes me not sleep late, all bad habits run out, running brings me the confidence that is full of the future.

But in fact my life is still energetic, thanks to the habit of having a very good sport for so many years.

There is no contradiction between running and study and work, and there is no contradiction at all. 
In fact, everyone should also know that sports sometimes have a greater role in promoting work and learning. 
Because everyone knows that heavy study and work, you definitely need a lot of energy, you must have this to ensure, so if you do not have enough energy, work and study will be discounted. 
So I am like this under normal circumstances, that is, for example, which time period can be properly exercised, for example, I can walk in the morning, do not exercise vigorously in the morning, and may not feel comfortable in the morning. 
I chose to walk in the morning, so I walked when I went to work, and then after work, I arrived at noon, maybe I would play table tennis and so on. 
If there is a chance, then in the evening, I might run, and then I am completely staggered from the work.
