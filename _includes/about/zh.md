Hi, I am *@feye* (Feng Ye), a graduated student in [Southeast University](http://www.seu.edu.cn/).

My research interests focus on developing methodologies and algorithms for complex or large-scale systems with multivariate or high-dimensional data, including intelligent sampling and sensing for data collection, data mining and information extraction for system modeling, and on-line monitoring and eï¬ƒcient anomaly detection for streaming data. In particular, my research can be categorized into the following areas: 



- Statistical modeling and optimization algorithms  

- Machine learning and data mining techniques for large-scale systems  

- On-line learning and real-time monitoring for streaming data analysis

- High-dimensional data analysis for systems monitoring, diagnostics and prognostics, and
