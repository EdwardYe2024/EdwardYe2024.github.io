Hi, I am *@feye* (Feng Ye), a third-year graduate student in [Southeast University](http://www.seu.edu.cn/).

My research interests focus on developing methodologies and algorithms for complex or large-scale systems with multivariate or high-dimensional data, including data mining and information extraction for system modeling, and on-line monitoring and eï¬ƒcient anomaly detection for streaming data. In particular, my research can be categorized into the following areas: 


- High-dimensional data analysis for systems monitoring, diagnostics and prognostics

- Feature extraction and fault detection via sensor fusion for streaming data analysis 

- Machine learning and data mining techniques for large-scale systems
